I'll be updating it as I build it, as well as posting my future changes.\r\n\r\n### How to view the site:\r\n## *[ Direct Link to functioning Desktop site ](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nullality/AddictionTest/blob/master/index.html)\r\n\r\n## *[ Direct Link to functioning Tablet site ](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nullality/AddictionTest/blob/master/tablet/index.html)\r\n\r\n### This site is/features: \r\n* Fixed page\r\n* Single continuous page \r\n* Navigation menu. \r\n* Dynamic - On Desktop the navigation floats, on mobile it doesn't. \r\n* Feel free to reach out with any questions. \r\n\r\n### How it was made\r\nI took the PDF and used it as inspiration, using Adobe Muse and quickly crafted a fixed width page layout, and began creating images to source.\r\n\r\nFinal product could be completely responsive, or it could be dynamic (changing depending on screen resolution).\r\n\r\nCustom, or Stock imagery would be added later, as well I would embed the font we use, so that the site contains less images and runs faster.\r\n\r\n### Contact:\r\nBrandon Miguelez\r\nArtxNullality@Gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
